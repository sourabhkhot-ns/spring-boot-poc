# üß™ Employee Notification Microservices POC

This project is a **proof-of-concept (POC)** microservices setup using **Spring Boot**, featuring two independent services:

- `employee-management-service`: Handles employee operations, stores employees in a JSON file, and notifies on changes.
- `notification-service`: Receives, logs, and stores notifications in a JSON file via HTTP.

These services are designed to be **containerized with Docker** and **deployed to AWS ECS Fargate** without a load balancer (public IPs are used for inter-service communication).

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3+
- Maven
- Docker
- AWS ECS Fargate
- **No database**: All data is stored in JSON files

## üßë‚Äçüíº employee-management-service

### ‚ûï Responsibilities

- Create, read, update, and delete employee records
- Store employees in a local `employees.json` file
- Notify `notification-service` via HTTP POST when an employee is created, updated, or deleted

### üì¶ REST Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint               | Description             |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/employees`       | Create a new employee   |
| GET    | `/api/employees`       | Get all employees       |
| GET    | `/api/employees/{id}`  | Get employee by ID      |
| PUT    | `/api/employees/{id}`  | Update employee by ID   |
| DELETE | `/api/employees/{id}`  | Delete employee by ID   |

### üîî Notification Call

When an employee is created, updated, or deleted, this service makes an HTTP POST call to:

```
http://${NOTIFICATION_URL}/api/notifications
```

Payload:
```json
{
  "message": "Employee Created|Employee Updated|Employee Deleted",
  "employeeId": 1
}
```

The `NOTIFICATION_URL` must be provided via an **environment variable**.

### üóÉ Storage
- Employees are stored in a local `employees.json` file (no database is used).

### üìù Logging
- All actions and errors are logged using SLF4J (console output by default).

---

## üì¢ notification-service

### ‚ûï Responsibilities

* Accept, log, and store incoming notifications
* Expose a GET endpoint to retrieve all notifications

### üì¶ REST Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                    |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/api/notifications` | Accept and store a notification|
| GET    | `/api/notifications` | Get all stored notifications   |

### üìÑ Request Format (POST)

```json
{
  "message": "Employee Created|Employee Updated|Employee Deleted",
  "employeeId": 1
}
```

### üìÑ Response Format (GET)

```json
[
  { "message": "Employee Created", "employeeId": 1 },
  { "message": "Employee Updated", "employeeId": 1 }
]
```

### üóÉ Storage
- Notifications are stored in a local `notifications.json` file (no database is used).

### üìù Logging
- All received notifications, file operations, and errors are logged using SLF4J.

---

## üê≥ Docker Setup

### Dockerfile (common to both services)

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
COPY target/*.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

### Build & Run Locally

```bash
# Package the app
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Build Docker image
# (do this in each service directory)
docker build -t employee-management-service .
docker build -t notification-service .

# Run with environment variable
# (run in separate terminals)
docker run -e NOTIFICATION_URL=http://<host-ip>:8082 \
  -p 8081:8081 employee-management-service

docker run -p 8082:8080 notification-service
```

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to AWS ECS Fargate

### 1. Create Amazon ECR Repositories

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name employee-management-service
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name notification-service
```

### 2. Push Docker Images

```bash
# Authenticate Docker
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

# Tag and push images
docker tag employee-management-service:latest <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/employee-management-service
docker push <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/employee-management-service

docker tag notification-service:latest <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/notification-service
docker push <ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/notification-service
```

## üßæ ECS Setup for Fargate

### Task Definitions (One Per Service)

* `networkMode`: `awsvpc`
* `requiresCompatibilities`: `["FARGATE"]`
* CPU: `256`, Memory: `512`
* Port mappings: `8081` (employee), `8082` (notification)
* Enable `assignPublicIp: ENABLED`
* Add `NOTIFICATION_URL` as environment variable in employee task

### Services

* Create 2 ECS services using the above task definitions
* Each service should run in the same VPC/Subnet
* Use a security group that allows traffic on ports 8081 and 8082
* No ALB needed ‚Äî each service will receive a public IP

---

## üîó Test the Flow

1. Get public IP of `employee-management-service` from ECS console.
2. Use curl or Postman to hit the create employee endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<EMPLOYEE_PUBLIC_IP>:8081/api/employees \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Sourabh",
    "lastName": "Khot",
    "email": "sourabh@example.com"
}'
```

3. This should trigger a notification sent to `notification-service`.

4. To view all notifications:

```bash
curl http://<NOTIFICATION_PUBLIC_IP>:8082/api/notifications
```

5. Check logs for both services for detailed action and error logs.
